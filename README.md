# SpatialYieldDataAnalysis

This dataset consists of rice yield data for different fields in Uruguay for two years, it contains data about 
soil properties in a field like SoilP, SoilK etc, and fertilizers used by farmers. 
The analysis is mostly focused on identifying the important factors that affect yield across different fields.
Is it due to management factors, or due to climate or due to soil properties in a field?


Any suggestions or comments are welcomed.
